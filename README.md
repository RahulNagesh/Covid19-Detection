# Covid19-Detection
A novel multimodal learning framework is proposed for early diagnosis of COVID-19 patient using hybrid deep fusion learning models. The proposed framework early classification of patient based on collected samples of chest X-ray images, cough(sound) and fatigue detection of infected people.

### Cough Dataset
The cough dataset comprised of various categories namely cough(two kinds; heavy and shallow), breathing(two kinds; heavy and shallow),
sustained vowel phonation(three kinds; a, e, o) and digit countings(two kinds; fast and normal).Figures shows wide-band spectograms of cough, breathing, counting and vowel  samples respectively.

### Results
Results demonstrate that the cough detection algorithm can classify between COVID-19 positive and and no findings event with an overall accuracy of 82.30%. The accuracy error graph of mean loss versus epochs of this convolutional neural network based model, for both training and testing data sets is shown below.
